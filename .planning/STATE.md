# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-19)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 93 — DB Schema + Dependency Collector

## Current Position

Phase: 93 (DB Schema + Dependency Collector) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-19

Progress: [          ] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 156 (across v1.0–v5.7.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 18

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

(Cleared — see PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history)

- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: MANAGED sentinel chosen over silent drop for unresolved Maven/NuGet versions — preserves row visibility in drift output
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: Separate tmpfiles per Gradle DSL branch to avoid cross-contamination when build.gradle and build.gradle.kts co-exist
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: detect_language uses csharp token; detect_project_type uses dotnet token — matches CLI naming convention
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: compgen -G used for .csproj/.sln glob detection in detect_project_type (bash builtin, no subprocess)
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: drift-types.sh: added --test-only guard (mirrors drift-versions.sh) to allow bats sourcing without triggering main loop under set -euo pipefail
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: C# partial class limitation documented as code comment only — cross-file merging deferred per Pitfall 13, out of Phase 92 scope
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: Fixtures contain only minimum files to trigger exactly one parser each — no cross-ecosystem contamination
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: Rule 1 bug fix: Maven relativePath extraction RSTART+15 was off-by-one (tag is 14 chars) — fixed to RSTART+14 so ../pom.xml resolves correctly
- [Phase 93-dep-collector]: Migration 010: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency, no hasCol() guards; 4-col UNIQUE includes manifest_file (NOT NULL) to handle mono-repo same-package-in-multiple-manifests; dep_kind column present in v5.8.0 schema despite only writing 'direct' (transient deferred to v5.9 per PITFALLS P6); ON DELETE CASCADE from services(id) means endScan() needs no new dep cleanup code

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hub companion THE-1018 must land separately for end-to-end library drift. Plugin can ship payload v1.1 independently (hub accepts both v1.0 and v1.1 per ticket).
