# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 57 — Edge Bundling

## Current Position

Phase: 57 (Edge Bundling) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 93 (across v1.0–v5.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 9

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.1: Incremental enhancement — features are improvements to existing graph UI, not an overhaul
- v5.1: All data for clickable panel, subgraph isolation, and edge bundling already exists in DB — pure frontend work
- v5.1: "What changed" overlay needs `scan_version_id` exposed in `/graph` response — Phase 55 delivers this before Phase 56 consumes it
- v5.1: scan_versions table with beginScan/endScan brackets already tracks per-scan row identity
- v5.1: Phase 55 (API) can be worked in parallel with phases 52-54 if desired — dependency is only Phase 56→55
- 52-01: Keyboard F shortcut delegates to fit-btn.click() rather than inlining fit math — single source of truth
- 52-01: initKeyboard() uses _wired flag for idempotency — safe to call on every loadProject
- [Phase 52-02]: 52-02: Used canvas.toDataURL('image/png') + anchor download pattern — no library, zero dependency overhead
- [Phase 52-02]: 52-02: Comma-selected #fit-btn, #export-btn in CSS — single source of truth for button styling
- [Phase 53-01]: 53-01: Pass node IDs via data-node-id on spans at render time — no reverse name-to-id lookup needed
- [Phase 53-01]: 53-01: selectAndPanToNode not exported — internal helper accessed exclusively via click delegation
- [Phase 53-01]: 53-01: Preserve current zoom scale when panning — only update transform.x/y to center target node
- [Phase 55-01]: 55-01: http.js required no changes — plain spread passes latest_scan_version_id automatically
- [Phase 55-01]: 55-01: latest_scan_version_id computed in getGraph() at DB layer, not HTTP layer — single source of truth
- [Phase 54-subgraph-isolation]: 54-01: getNeighborIdsNHop placed immediately after getNeighborIds in utils.js — natural adjacency, same edge traversal pattern
- [Phase 54-subgraph-isolation]: 54-01: isolatedNodeId and isolationDepth placed after blastCache cluster — blast and isolation are parallel mode concerns
- [Phase 54-subgraph-isolation]: 54-02: Isolation block placed as step 6 after hideIsolated — stacks on existing filters, narrows subset
- [Phase 54-subgraph-isolation]: 54-02: Esc handler guard broadened to OR condition — clears isolation even when no node selected
- [Phase 54-subgraph-isolation]: 54-02: I handler uses case 'i'/'I' pattern matching Phase 52 F handler convention
- [Phase 56]: latestScanVersionId and showChanges placed after currentProject — logically adjacent scan-awareness fields
- [Phase 56]: scan_version_id uses nullish coalescing (?? null) — preserves 0 as a valid version ID
- [Phase 56-02]: 56-02: Glow ring placed after selection border and before label — visible above node but below text
- [Phase 56-02]: 56-02: isNewEdge block placed after mismatch override so mismatch red wins over yellow
- [Phase 56-02]: 56-02: cloneNode pattern used for changes-btn listener — consistent with fit-btn convention
- [Phase 57-edge-bundling]: 57-01: Bundle fresh per frame inside render() — not from state.edgeBundles cache — avoids stale state bugs
- [Phase 57-edge-bundling]: 57-01: Count badge offset 12px perpendicular to edge so it does not obscure the mismatch cross at midpoint
- [Phase 57-edge-bundling]: 57-01: Bundles with count === 1 follow same code path — no regression branch needed
