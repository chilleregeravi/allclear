# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-23)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** v0.1.2 Ligamen Residue Purge — hard-remove every ligamen/LIGAMEN/@ligamen reference

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (roadmap complete, ready for Phase 101 planning)
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap complete — 5 phases defined (101-105), 42/42 requirements mapped
Last activity: 2026-04-23 — Roadmap created by gsd-roadmapper

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 184 (across v1.0–v5.8.0 rolled into v0.1.0, plus v0.1.1 = 12 plans)
- Total milestones shipped: 20 (Ligamen v1.0–v5.8.0 + Arcanon v0.1.0 + v0.1.1)
- Phases this milestone: 5 (101-105)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- **v0.1.2 policy:** Zero ligamen references. No back-compat, no two-read fallbacks, no stderr deprecation warnings for legacy env vars. Breaking change for v5.x users is acceptable.
- **v0.1.2 scope discipline:** Refactor only — zero behavior changes outside the rename.
- **v0.1.2 phase structure:** 5 phases chosen over 4 (keeps VER isolated as release gate) and 6+ (avoids splitting SRC-01..08 finely; cosmetic rename is a single sweep). Phases 101 + 102 + 104 can execute in parallel; 103 depends on 101+102; 105 depends on all.
- Phase 101-03: Renamed npm package @ligamen/runtime-deps to @arcanon/runtime-deps without version bump — sentinel diff-based idempotency handles the rename in one re-install.
- Parallel-execution caveat: concurrent executors in the same worktree can cause commit-scope leak on git add/commit. Future milestones should sandbox parallel executors in worktrees or serialize commits.
- Phase 101-04: COLLECTION_NAME rename is a hard break; existing ligamen-impact collections orphaned on upgrade (rebuild via /arcanon:map).
- Phase 101-04: readHomeConfig() legacy ~/.ligamen fallback removed without deprecation warning per zero-tolerance policy.
- Phase 101-04: Runtime-describing JSDoc lines aligned with code; pure historical prose deferred to Phase 102.
- 101-02: Hard-remove LIGAMEN_* reads — no two-read fallbacks, no stderr deprecation notices
- 101-02: session-start.sh disable guard now reads only ARCANON_DISABLE_SESSION_START — LIGAMEN_DISABLE_SESSION_START stops disabling the hook (intentional breaking change)
- 101-02: worker-start.sh port resolution chain reduced to env.ARCANON_WORKER_PORT → settings.json .ARCANON_WORKER_PORT → arcanon.config.json .impact-map.port → 37888 default
- 101-02: lib/data-dir.sh preference order reduced from 5 steps to 2 — $ARCANON_DATA_DIR → $HOME/.arcanon

### Pending Todos

- Plan Phase 101: Runtime Purge (18 REQs — ENV/PATH/PKG)
- Plan Phase 102: Source Cosmetic Rename (8 REQs — SRC)
- Plan Phase 103: Test Suite Rewrite (7 REQs — TST)
- Plan Phase 104: Docs & README Purge (6 REQs — DOC/README)
- Plan Phase 105: Verification Gate (3 REQs — VER)

### Blockers/Concerns

- PreToolUse hook p99 latency on macOS is 130ms vs the 50ms Linux target — documented caveat, not a regression.
- `/arcanon:update` depends on Claude Code CLI shape for plugin install/uninstall.
- Two non-blocking tech-debt items from v0.1.1 audit (not addressed in v0.1.2 scope): session-start.sh inline hash duplication, stale planning paragraph in commands/update.md.
