# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Service Dependency Intelligence — Phase 14: Storage Foundation (ready to plan)

Phase: 14 of 21 (Storage Foundation)
Plan: — of — (not started)
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v2.0]: Cross-impact redesigned from symbol grep to service dependency graph
- [v2.0]: SQLite primary, ChromaDB optional (follows claude-mem pattern)
- [v2.0]: Agent-based scanning — no external tools (tree-sitter, stack-graphs)
- [v2.0]: User confirms all findings before persisting (hard gate, not toggle)
- [v2.0]: Worker auto-starts when impact-map section present in config
- [v2.0]: Service is the unit, not repo — works for mono-repo and multi-repo
- [v2.0]: Incremental scans by default, full re-scan on demand
- [v2.0]: MCP server reads SQLite directly — no worker dependency for queries
- [v2.0]: Background subagents cannot access MCP tools (issue #13254) — agent scan runs foreground only
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: type:module added to package.json — all worker files use ESM import syntax
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: openDb() exported as named export so Plan 02 tools can import without re-opening DB
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: Fastify and HTTP deps added in 16-01 to avoid second npm install in Phase 17
- [Phase 15-01]: DATA_DIR for PID/port files is ~/.allclear (machine-wide), overridable via ALLCLEAR_DATA_DIR
- [Phase 15-01]: Port resolution order: ALLCLEAR_WORKER_PORT env -> settings.json -> allclear.config.json -> 37888
- [Phase 15-01]: PORT_FILE written before spawning so callers can read port immediately after worker-start.sh exits
- [Phase 17-http-server-web-ui]: Server binds to 127.0.0.1 only — never 0.0.0.0 — hard-coded for security
- [Phase 17-http-server-web-ui]: Readiness route registered first in Fastify — guarantees probe works before DB init
- [Phase 17-http-server-web-ui]: null queryEngine returns 503 on data routes — expected transient state before DB ready, not an error
- [Phase 14-01]: Top-level await used in db.js to preload ES module migrations before any openDb() call
- [Phase 14-01]: FTS5 content tables with trigger-based sync (ai/ad/au per table) chosen for incremental index updates

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 18]: Agent hallucination rate unknown until tested on real repos — plan for prompt iteration loop
- [Phase 16]: MCP tool description length limits and .mcp.json registration convention should be re-verified at implementation time (MCP spec evolves)
- [Phase 17]: D3 Canvas hit detection for node click/hover requires custom point-in-circle math — spike before full UI implementation
